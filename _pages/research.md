<p><strong>How does niche partitioning impact the ecological dynamics of terrestrial predators?</strong></p>
<p>Niche partitioning is the concept that, as a result of competition, organisms are under pressure to occupy specific niches, with the separating factor often different species, sexes, or developmental stages. Scorpions are an excellent terrestrial model for investigating niche partitioning because they are abundant, can easily be detected <em>in situ</em> with ultraviolet light, &nbsp;are opportunistic predators willing to cannibalize one another, and are also under predation pressure by larger terrestrial animals. Understanding these dynamics in the context of niche partitioning allow us to observe what competitive factors may be at play and on a broader level contribute to a better understanding of natural history.</p>
