Beyond research, I have been involved in a variety of biodiversity-related projects promoting the conservation of arthropods through a combination of museum curation, species monitoring efforts, and scientific communication.

<b>Cornell Univeristy Insect Collection (CUIC) Curation</b>

Since August 2016, I have been the undergraduate lead for a NSF grant funded initiative to curate the macrolepidoptera and database specimens dissected by John G. Franclemont. To date we have curated nearly 6000 species and two families (Geometridae, and Notodontidae). The system of curating that I set in place is still ongoing.

<b>Other Curation Projects at Cornell University</b>

Furthermore, I was involved in curating two teaching collections — the Insect Biology Teaching Collection (Fall 2017) and the Medical and Veterinary Entomology Teaching Collection (Spring 2019). Both of these collections serve several dozen students each year and serve as a synoptic collection for students to use as a reference to idnetify their own collections or learn how to key out a variety of arthropods. For the Insect Biology Teaching Collection, I curated the Lepidoptera which had not been curated in about 15-20 years, meaning that some major taxonomic changes had not yet been implemented (namely the movement of some other families such as Arctiidae and Lymantriidae into subfamilies of Erebidae). In the Cornell University Medical and Veterinary Entomology Teaching Collection (Spring 2019), I curated the entire collection of XXX specimens representing XXX species, nearly all of which are arthropods of medical or veterinary significance.

<b>Empire State Native Pollinator Survey</b>

The Empire State Native Pollinator Survey is a DEC-funded effort developed by the New York Natural Heritage Program intended to “determine the conservation status of a wide array of native insect pollinators in nonagricultural habitats”. For this project I identified thousands of specimens of mostly native wild bees using a combination of primary literature references, comparison with reference specimens in the CUIC, and 


<b>Spiders: Fear and Fascination</b>

In 2017, Dr. Linda Rayor became part of the Australian Museum’s efforts to create a North American analog to their Spiders exhibition. I worked with fellow undergraduate students to collect and preserve spider specimens in a lifelike position for museum display. 


<b>National Moth Week</b>

National Moth Week is a global citizen science project founded in 2011 by Liti Haramaty and David Moskowitz. In 2013, I became a team member of National Moth Week and have aided in decision-making and strategy for the organization as well as coordinate efforts between some of our citizen science partners such as Project Noah and iNaturalist.
