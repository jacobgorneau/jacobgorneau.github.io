I’ve been fortunate to work on a variety of projects related to entomology. These have been directed toward my interests of arthropod diversity and evolution as well as museum work and outreach. Check out the brief descriptions below and click to learn more!

CUIC Curation

Since August 2016, I have been the undergraduate lead for a NSF grant funded initiative to curate the macrolepidoptera and database specimens dissected by John G. Franclemont. To date we have curated nearly 6000 species and two families (Geometridae, and Notodontidae).


Empire State Native Pollinator Survey

The Empire State Native Pollinator Survey is a DEC-funded effort developed by the New York Natural Heritage Program intended to “determine the conservation status of a wide array of native insect pollinators in nonagricultural habitats”.


Spiders: Fear and Fascination

In 2017, Dr. Linda Rayor became part of the Australian Museum’s efforts to create a North American analog to their Spiders exhibition. I worked with fellow undergraduate students to collect and preserve spider specimens in a lifelike position for museum display. 


National Moth Week

National Moth Week is a global citizen science project founded in 2011 by Liti Haramaty and David Moskowitz. In 2013, I became a team member of National Moth Week and have aided in decision-making and strategy for the organization as well as coordinate efforts between some of our citizen science partners such as Project Noah and iNaturalist.
