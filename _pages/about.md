I'm currently a research assistant at the California Academy of Sciences working on using museum collections to understand arachnid evolution and biodiversity. I graduated with my B.S. in Entomology at Cornell in 2020, and received my M.S. in December 2022 from San Francisco State University. I'm incredibly passionate about all arthropods, but my previous and current work centers on moths and arachnids in the context of collections. I'm also incredibly passionate about outreach and have been involved in several projects involving communicating science and preparing scientific displays.
