I’m currently a PhD student at UC Berkeley working on using museum collections to understand arachnid evolution, conservation, and biodiversity. At UC Berkeley, I am in the <a href="https://theeliaslab.com/">Elias Lab</a> and EvoLab (Gillespie). I also do my work with the California Academy of Sciences where I completed my master's.

I graduated with my B.S. in Entomology at Cornell in 2020, and received my M.S. in December 2022 from San Francisco State University working at the California Academy of Sciences in the <a href="https://www.arachnerds.info/">Arachnerds Lab</a>. I’m incredibly passionate about all arthropods, but my previous and current work centers on moths and arachnids in the context of collections. I’m also incredibly passionate about outreach and have been involved in several projects involving communicating science and preparing scientific displays.
