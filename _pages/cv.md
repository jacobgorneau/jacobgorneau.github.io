Below is the most up-to-date version of my curriculum vitae. Please see my <a href="https://github.com/jacobgorneau/professional" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">professional repository</a> for my infographic and typical resume. My curriculum vitae and typical resume were built in LATEX on OverLeaf using a template, and the code I used is located in this repository. My infographic resume was adapted from a Word Template in Adobe Illustrator.
